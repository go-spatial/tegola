Usage and documentation
=======================

Please see http://godoc.org/gopkg.in/go-playground/colors.v1 for detailed usage docs.

#Example
```go
hex, err := colors.ParseHex("#fff")
rgb, err := colors.ParseRGB("rgb(0,0,0)")
rgb, err := colors.RGB(0,0,0)
rgba, err := colors.ParseRGBA("rgba(0,0,0,1)")
rgba, err := colors.RGBA(0,0,0,1)

// don't know which color, it was user selectable
color, err := colors.Parse("#000)

color.ToRGB()   // rgb(0,0,0)
color.ToRGBA()  // rgba(0,0,0,1)
color.ToHEX()   // #000000
color.IsLight() // false
color.IsDark()  // true

```

How to Contribute
=================

There will always be a development branch for each version i.e. `v1-development`. In order to contribute, 
please make your pull requests against those branches.

If the changes being proposed or requested are breaking changes, please create an issue, for discussion 
or create a pull request against the highest development branch for example this package has a 
v1 and v1-development branch however, there will also be a v2-development brach even though v2 doesn't exist yet.

I am not a color expert by any means and am sure that there could be better or even more efficient
ways to accomplish the color conversion and so forth and I welcome any suggestions or pull request to help!
