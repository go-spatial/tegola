Tegola is a vector tile server delivering [Mapbox Vector Tiles](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec) with support for PostGIS and GeoPackage data providers.

## Features
- Native geometry processing (simplification, clipping, make valid, intersection, contains, scaling, translation)
- [Mapbox Vector Tile v2 specification](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec) compliant.
- Embedded viewer with auto generated style for quick data visualization and inspection.
- Support for PostGIS and GeoPackage data providers. Extensible design to support additional data providers.
- Support for several cache backends: [file](cache/file), [s3](cache/s3), [redis](cache/redis), [azure blob store](cache/azblob).
- Cache seeding and invalidation via individual tiles (ZXY), lat / lon bounds and ZXY tile list.
- Parallelized tile serving and geometry processing.
- Support for Web Mercator (3857) and WGS84 (4326) projections.
- Support for [AWS Lambda](cmd/tegola_lambda).

```

## Running tegola as a vector tile server
1. Download the appropriate binary of tegola for your platform via the [release page](https://github.com/go-spatial/tegola/releases).
2. Setup your config file and run. Dy default tegola looks for a `config.toml` in the same directory as the binary. You can set a different location for the `config.toml` using a command flag:

```
./tegola serve --config=/path/to/config.toml
```

## Server Endpoints

```
/
```

The server root will display a built in viewer with an auto generated style. For example:

![tegola built in viewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/go-spatial/tegola/v0.4.0/docs/screenshots/built-in-viewer.png "tegola built in viewer")


```
/maps/:map_name/:z/:x/:y
```

Return vector tiles for a map. The URI supports the following variables:

- `:map_name` is the name of the map as defined in the `config.toml` file.
- `:z` is the zoom level of the map.
- `:x` is the row of the tile at the zoom level.
- `:y` is the column of the tile at the zoom level.


```
/maps/:map_name/:layer_name/:z/:x/:y
```

Return vector tiles for a map layer. The URI supports the same variables as the map URI with the additional variable:

- `:layer_name` is the name of the map layer as defined in the `config.toml` file.


```
/capabilities
```

Return a JSON encoded list of the server's configured maps and layers with various attributes.

```
/capabilities/:map_name
```

Return [TileJSON](https://github.com/mapbox/tilejson-spec) details about the map.

```
/maps/:map_name/style.json
```

Return an auto generated [Mapbox GL Style](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/) for the configured map.

## Configuration
The tegola config file uses the [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) format. The following example shows how to configure a PostGIS data provider with two layers. The first layer includes a `tablename`, `geometry_field` and an `id_field`. The second layer uses a custom `sql` statement instead of the `tablename` property.

Under the `maps` section, map layers are associated with data provider layers and their `min_zoom` and `max_zoom` values are defined. Optionally, `default_tags` can be setup which will be encoded into the layer. If the same tags are returned from a data provider, the data provider's values will take precedence.

```toml

```

\* more on PostgreSQL SSL mode [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/libpq-ssl.html). The `postgis` config also supports "ssl_cert" and "ssl_key" options are required, corresponding semantically with "PGSSLKEY" and "PGSSLCERT". These options do not check for environment variables automatically. See the section [below](#environment-variables) on injecting environment variables into the config.

### Supported PostGIS SQL tokens
The following tokens are supported in custom SQL queries for the PostGIS data provider:

- `!BBOX!` - [required] Will convert the z/x/y values into a bounding box to query the feature table with.
- `!ZOOM!` - [optional] Pass in the zoom value for the request. Useful for filtering feature results by zoom.

## Environment Variables

#### Config TOML
Environment variables can be injected into the configuration file. One caveat is that the injection has to be within a string, though the value it represents does not have to be a string.

The above config example could be written as:
```toml
# register data providers
[[providers]]
name = "test_postgis"
type = "postgis"
host = "${POSTGIS_HOST}"    # postgis database host (required)
port = "${POSTGIS_PORT}"    # recall this value must be an int
database = "${POSTGIS_DB}"
user = "tegola"
password = ""
srid = 3857
max_connections = "${POSTGIS_MAX_CONN}"
```

#### SQL Debugging
The following environment variables can be used for debugging:

`TEGOLA_SQL_DEBUG` specify the type of SQL debug information to output. Currently support two values:

- `LAYER_SQL`: print layer SQL as they are parsed from the config file.
- `EXECUTE_SQL`: print SQL that is executed for each tile request and the number of items it returns or an error.

#### Usage

```bash
$ TEGOLA_SQL_DEBUG=LAYER_SQL tegola serve --config=/path/to/conf.toml
```

The following environment variables can be used to control various runtime options:

`TEGOLA_OPTIONS` specify a set of options comma or space delimited. Supports the following options

- `DontSimplifyGeo` to turn off simplification for all layers.
- `SimplifyMaxZoom={{int}}` to set the max zoom that simplification will apply to. (14 is default)


## Client side debugging
When debugging client side, it's often helpful to to see an outline of a tile along with it's Z/X/Y values. To encode a debug layer into every tile add the query string variable `debug=true` to the URL template being used to request tiles. For example:

```
http://localhost:8080/maps/mymap/{z}/{x}/{y}.vector.pbf?debug=true
```

The requested tile will be encode a layer with the `name` value set to `debug` and include two features:

 - `debug_outline`: a line feature that traces the border of the tile
 - `debug_text`: a point feature in the middle of the tile with the following tags:
   - `zxy`: a string with the `Z`, `X` and `Y` values formatted as: `Z:0, X:0, Y:0`

## Building from source

Tegola is written in [Go](https://golang.org/) and requires Go 1.8+ to compile from source. To build tegola from source, make sure you have Go installed and have cloned the repository to your `$GOPATH`. Navigate to the repository then run the following commands:

```bash
cd cmd/tegola/
go build
```

You will now have a binary named `tegola` in the current directory which is [ready for running](#running-tegola).

**Build Flags**
The following build flags can be used to turn off certain features of tegola:

- `noAzblobCache` - turn off the Azure Blob cache back end.
- `noS3Cache` - turn off the AWS S3 cache back end.
- `noRedisCache` - turn off the Redis cache back end.
- `noPostgisProvider` - turn off the PostGIS data provider.
- `noGpkgProvider` - turn off the GeoPackage data provider. Note, GeoPackage uses CGO and will be turned off if the environment variable `CGO_ENABLED=0` is set prior to building.
- `noViewer` - turn off the built in viewer.
- `pprof` - enable [Go profiler](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/). Start profile server by setting the environment `TEGOLA_HTTP_PPROF_BIND` environment (e.g. `TEGOLA_HTTP_PPROF_BIND=localhost:6060`).

Example of using the build flags to turn of the Redis cache back end, the GeoPackage provider and the built in viewer.

```bash
go build -tags 'noRedisCache noGpkgProvider noViewer'
```


**Turning off CGO**
Tegola uses CGO for certain functionality (i.e. GeoPackge support). To build tegola without CGO use the following command:

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build
```
