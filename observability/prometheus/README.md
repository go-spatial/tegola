# Prometheus Observability Provider

The Prometheus Observability provider manages the collection of various
metrics for Tegola's various subsystems.

The connection between Tegola and Prometheus is configured in the config
file (`tegola.toml`.) An example of minimum configuration :

```toml

[observer]
type = "prometheus"

```

The metrics will be exposed on the `/metrics` end point.

### Configuration Properties

- `type` (string): [Required] the type of the observer, must be "`prometheus`".
- `variables` (array of strings): [Optional] A set of tokens that should be replaced in the url for HTTP or additional labels for cache providers. Currently, supported tokens are:
  * `:map_name` [Default]
  * `:layer_name` [Default]
  * `:z` [Default]
  * `:x`
  * `:y`
- `push_url` (string) : [Optional] To push to a Prometheus Gateway, set the push_url to the gateway's URL. Note: this should only be used for ephemeral jobs, such as `tegola cache seed` or `tegola cache pruge` commands.
- `push_cadence` (int) : [Optional] How often to push to the Prometheus Gateway. Defaults to 10 secs. Use a zero or less to only push at the end of the process.


### Metrics exposed

#### tegola build info

#####  tegola_build_info 

A gauge with build information from the running command

###### Labels

* branch - if set, the git branch of this built binary
* revision - the git short revision number
* version - the set version number
* command - the running command
* tags - the build tags that were used to build the Tegola Binary


Use this in conjunction with other command to compare metrics across
versions of the application.
